The variant with the highest score in the GWAS was rs10489070 but the base associated was not reported. rs16890979 Val253Ile in GLUT9 was most strongly associated with uric acid levels, with each copy of the minor allele associated with 0.47 mg/dl less uric acid, this was more pronounced in women than men, and pre-menopausal women than post-menopausal women indicating an estrogen component to the relationship.",T,TRUE

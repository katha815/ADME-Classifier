1. extract text/(convert)numbers for all interested columns
->so that the missing values will appear as NaN
2. Finalizing the dataset by 
1) extract mean for popFs (seems making no difference but 
just to ensure all searched results are considered)
2) one-hot-encoding AA, Codons and FLAGS;
3) and delete duplicates
3. Check the transferred dataset (should have 335 rows) and pick suitable
imputation method
